🔭 I am a Ph.D. student at University of Delaware working at [Sensify Lab](https://sensifylab.cis.udel.edu/), I am conducting research under [Prof. Matthew Mauriello](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mlm/) to work on human-centered design, the engineering of software systems that extend user capabilities, and practical applications of technology that address high-value social problems. Currently I am developing crowdsourcing and intervention tools that help to aggregate data about news articles and power community-driven review systems. The long-term aim of my research study is to explore recommendation algorithms and how interventions in browsing patterns might improve media literacy.
I am passionate about understanding users’ attitudes and behaviors to enable innovative technologies that make pleasant and healthy online experiences focusing on younger generations. I want to utilize my User Experience Research expertise and specialty in Machine Learning & Natural language Processing and Data Analytics to bridge the gap between users’ needs and technology.
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Lis Nepal Pvt Ltd](https://lisnepal.com.np/)

🌱 I’m currently learning fundamental concepts in User Experience Research and Design thinking in HCI
